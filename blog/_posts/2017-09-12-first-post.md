Hello, this is the first post. I created this blog because I wanted a place to document what I have been learning. Currently I have been studying the Elixir and Rust languages. With Elixir, I have been playing with Phoenix Channels for real-time apps back-end. I have been studying some general computer science subjects and using Rust to train for classic searching and sorting algorithms.

So here I will document my learning path, things I find interesting, some reference stuff I find useful and also things I am building with these tools and how I am contributing to some open source projects.

I enrolled in a computer science course at the university, but I switched to Civil Engineering, which I will be graduating very soon. After that, I plan on studying computer science with online courses and specialize in machine learning.

I will also post on this blog about other stuff that I personally like, such as movies, tv shows and motor sports.
