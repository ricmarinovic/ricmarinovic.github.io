Hello, this is the first post. I wanted a place to document what I have been learning. Currently I have been studying the Elixir language and Ruby on Rails. Even though I got to know Rails since its beginning, I've never tried to create anything new with it, just learned what it could do.

So here I will document my learning path, things I find interesting, some reference stuff I find useful and also things I am building with these tools and how I am contributing to some open source projects.

I will also post on this blog about other stuff that I personally like, such as movies, tv shows and motor sports.
