Hello, this is the first post. I created this blog because I wanted a place to document what I have been learning. So here I will document my learning path, things I find interesting, some reference stuff I find useful and also things I am building with these tools and how I am contributing to some open source projects. I will also post on this blog about other stuff that I personally like, such as movies, tv shows and motor sports.
