- Developed the game in pure Elixir separating the game logic from the consumer layers.
- Created a Phoenix application to consume the core game using Phoenix Channels for real-time communication and updates.
- Engineered the application to leverage Elixirâ€™s potential for high-availability and fault tolerance through the use of OTP.
